# Voice Recorder Application

A Java application for recording audio from a microphone and saving it as a WAV file. The program captures real-time audio input and stores it in an uncompressed format for further processing or playback.

## Features
- Records audio from the system's default microphone.
- Saves recordings as **WAV** files.
- Simple start/stop functionality via console commands.
- Displays confirmation messages for start, stop, and file creation.
- Lightweight and easy to use, focused on core recording functionality.

## About
This project was created to explore the use of the **Java Sound API** and to provide a minimalistic tool for capturing voice or ambient sound. The application is a simple proof-of-concept for real-time audio processing in Java.
This project was developed as part of my coursework in the **Telecommunications** subject. The goal was to implement a basic audio recording system using Java's native capabilities and gain hands-on experience with real-time signal processing concepts.
